<div class=""flex h-24 w-24 shrink-0 flex-col items-center justify-center gap-1.5 rounded-2xl bg-[#F9F9FD] py-2 px-1"">In the rich tapestry of Indian cuisine, Ladies' Fingers, known locally as ""bhindi"" or ""okra,"" holds a prominent place. This versatile vegetable, with its elongated shape and tender texture, is celebrated for its culinary adaptability. Often used in curries, stir-fries, and even as a crispy side dish, bhindi adds a unique mucilaginous quality that thickens gravies and enhances flavours. Its popularity spans across regional variations, from spicy masalas in the North to coconut-infused preparations in the South. Beyond its culinary prowess, bhindi symbolises simplicity and resilience, thriving in diverse climates and becoming a staple in everyday Indian kitchens.</div>
